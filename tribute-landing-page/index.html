        </div>
        <div id="timeline">
            <ul>
                <li>1996–2002: Early work and Roc-A-Fella</li>
                <p>Kanye West began his early production career in the mid-1990s, creating beats primarily for burgeoning local artists around his area, eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic soul records. His first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on Down to Earth, the 1996 debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav.[37] For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for Deric "D-Dot" Angelettie. Because of his association with D-Dot, West was not able to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and producer of the Go-Getters, a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him, GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe, and Arrowstar.</p>

                <li>2003–2006: The College Dropout and Late Registration</li>
                <p>West recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident. Once he had completed the album, it was leaked months before its release date.[45] However, West decided to use the opportunity to review the album, and The College Dropout was significantly remixed, remastered, and revised before being released. As a result, certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted, among them "Keep the Receipt" with Ol' Dirty Bastard and "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" with Consequence.[54] West meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, improved drum programming and new verses.[45] West's perfectionism led The College Dropout to have its release postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003.</p>
                
                <li>2007–2009: Graduation, 808s & Heartbreak, and VMAs controversy</li>
                <p>Fresh off spending the previous year touring the world with U2 on their Vertigo Tour, West felt inspired to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large arenas.[72] To this end, West incorporated the synthesizer into his hip-hop production, utilized slower tempos, and experimented with electronic music and influenced by music of the 1980s.[73][74] In addition to U2, West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin in terms of melody and chord progression.[74][75] To make his next effort, the third in a planned tetralogy of education-themed studio albums,[76] more introspective and personal in lyricism, West listened to folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his wordplay and storytelling ability.</p>

                <li>2010–2012: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and collaborations</li>
                <p>Following the highly publicized incident, West took a brief break from music and threw himself into fashion, only to hole up in Hawaii for the next few months writing and recording his next album.[95] Importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording, West kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments. Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for Complex, was present during the sessions and described the "communal" atmosphere as thus: "With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and we are here to contribute, challenge, and inspire."[95] A variety of artists contributed to the project, including close friends Jay-Z, Kid Cudi and Pusha T, as well as off-the-wall collaborations, such as with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver.</p>

                <li>2013–2015: Yeezus and Adidas collaboration</li>
                <p>Sessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel.[107] Determined to "undermine the commercial",[108] he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music.[109] Primarily inspired by architecture,[107] West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach.[110] Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.[111][112] Yeezus, West's sixth album, was released June 18, 2013, to rave reviews from critics.[113] It became his sixth consecutive number one debut, but also marked his lowest solo opening week sales.[114] Def Jam issued "Black Skinhead" to radio in July 2013 as the album's lead single.</p>
                
                <li>2016–2017: The Life of Pablo and tour cancellation</li>
                <p>West announced in January 2016 that SWISH would be released on February 11, and later that month, released new songs "Real Friends" and a snippet of "No More Parties in LA" with Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which he releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden.[140] In the weeks leading up to the album's release, West became embroiled in several Twitter controversies[141] and released several changing iterations of the tracklist for the new album.</p>

                <li>2017–2019: Ye and the Wyoming Sessions</li>
                <p>It was reported in May 2017 that West was recording new music in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with a wide range of collaborators.[162][163][164] In April 2018, West announced plans to write a philosophy book entitled Break the Simulation,[165] later clarifying that he was sharing the book "in real time" on Twitter and began posting content that was likened to "life coaching".[166] Later that month, he also announced two new albums, a solo album and self-titled collaboration with Kid Cudi under the name Kids See Ghosts, both of which would be released in June.[167] Additionally, he revealed he would produce upcoming albums by GOOD Music label-mates Pusha T and Teyana Taylor, as well as Nas.[168] Shortly thereafter, West released the non-album singles "Lift Yourself", a "strange, gibberish track" featuring nonsensical lyrics, and "Ye vs. the People", in which he and T.I. discussed West's controversial support of Donald Trump.</p>

                <li>2019–present: Jesus Is King, Donda, and Donda 2</li>
                <p>On January 6, 2019, West started his weekly "Sunday Service" orchestration which includes soul variations of both West's and others' songs attended by multiple celebrities including the Kardashians, Charlie Wilson, and Kid Cudi.[182] West previewed a new song, "Water" at his "Sunday Service" orchestration performance at weekend 2 of Coachella.[183]

                On October 25, 2019, he released Jesus Is King, a Christian hip hop album.[184] On the US charts, the album became the first to ever top the Billboard 200, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, Top Rap Albums, Top Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums at the same time.[185] He also collaborated with Vanessa Beecroft on two operas, Nebuchadnezzar and Mary.[186][187] On December 25, 2019, West and Sunday Service released Jesus Is Born, containing 19 songs including several re-workings of older West songs.</p>
